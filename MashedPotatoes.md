# Mashed Potatoes

Source: I forget

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs yellow, red, or white potatoes
- 1 cup milk or chicken stock (or a combination)
- 3 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp salt (and more to taste)
- 0.25 tsp pepper
- Splash cream (optional)

## Instructions

1. Rinse and scrub the potatoes.  Peel skin if desired.
2. Dice potatoes such that theyâ€™re roughly similar in size.  Place into a large saucepan.
3. Add a tbsp of salt and cover with water.
4. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a low simmer.  Cook until the potatoes fall apart when pierced with a fork.  This takes about 15-20 minutes.
5. Drain then return the potatoes to the saucepan, and leave them for about 5 minutes to let off excess steam that can make mashed potatoes watery.
6. In a separate bowl, add the milk/stock and butter, and heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is warm.
7. Pour the milk/stock and butter mixture in with the potatoes, and then mash until creamy.
8. Stir in the pepper and (optionally) the splash of cream.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
9. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
