## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 large white onion, chopped
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1½ pounds Yukon gold potatoes, about 5, chopped
- 1½ cups cooked white beans, drained and rinsed
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Optional Toppings

- Scallions or chives
- Coconut bacon
- Greek yogurt, optional
- Cheddar cheese, optional

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Sauté 6 to 8 minutes, until softened.
2. Add the garlic, stir, and cook 2 more minutes. Stir in the white wine vinegar and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds, and then add the broth, potatoes, and white beans. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer 30 minutes.
3. Let cool slightly, then transfer half of the soup to a blender with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, the mustard, lemon juice, and paprika. Blend until smooth and return the pureed soup back to the pot.
4. Use a potato masher to gently smash the potato chunks and beans. Season to taste with more salt and pepper and serve with desired toppings.
